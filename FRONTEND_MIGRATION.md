### Add Beer to List
- **Old**: `POST /user/lists/add` with `{beer_id, list_type}`
- **New**: `POST /user/lists/All%20Beers/beers/{beer_id}` (no body)

### Compare Beers

- **New**: `POST /user/compare` with `{beer1_id, beer2_id, winner_id, list_name}`

## Backend Compatibility Issues Resolved

### âœ… **Password Field Compatibility**
- **Issue**: Legacy users from Python backend had `password_hash` field, while TypeScript backend creates `hashed_password` field
- **Fix**: Updated login route to check both field names for backward compatibility
- **Result**: Both old and new users can now log in successfully

### âœ… **Mixed Beer ID Format Compatibility**
- **Issue**: Legacy beers from Python backend have string IDs ("1", "2", "3"), while new beers use MongoDB ObjectId format
- **Fix**: Updated all backend routes to handle both ID formats:
  - Beer routes: Try ObjectId first, fallback to string ID lookup
  - User routes: Handle both formats in add beer and comparison operations
  - List routes: Query beers using both ID formats simultaneously
- **Result**: All beers work regardless of ID format (legacy strings or new ObjectIds)

### âœ… **Database Schema Consistency**
- TypeScript backend maintains compatibility with existing MongoDB data
- New users created with consistent field naming
- Old users continue to work without migration needed
- Mixed beer ID formats supported seamlessly
